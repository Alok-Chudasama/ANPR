<h1><b>Automatic Number Plate Recognition</b></h1>

This is an Automatic Number plate detection as well as recognition model and deployment. You can simply upload or capture the image of a vehicle and the model will give you the Vehicle Number as an output. We had made 3 deployments for the same i.e.(Tf.js, Tf.lite and Flask).<br>

We had basically used mobileNet transfer learning model, pytesseract, tesseract.js and google ML android kit for making the Deep learning model.<br>
